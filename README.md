# Options Modelling and Pricing in Python

This project was created to expand my knowledge and intuition in Python and the financial instruments of options.

## About the Project

The app within this repository is a platform dedicated to showcasing projects focused on the topic of options pricing. Dive into the world of options and explore their pricing mechanisms and the impact on profit and loss through the projects listed below. Whether you are looking to:

- Understand the fundamentals
- Visualize basic options pricing
- Analyze profit and loss (P&L) charts

You will find a range of tools built to help develop intuition. Delve into basic or more advanced models like the Black-Scholes options pricing model and discover how various factors influence options pricing and their outcomes.

Below are four images of the overall project:
